            Hello! My name is Nirosh Perera, the hand behind the paintings! Born and raised in Sri Lanka, I had the opportunity to
            venture into the tropical jungles to observe wildlife at close quarters. My interest in wildlife and specifically birds,
            started at a very young age, where my first endeavour was a series of Sri Lankan birds, drawn with felt pens for a school
            project. I was 12.
            <br><br>
            Although I didn't pursue art as a subject after the age of 16, I continued to paint animals and human portraits.
            It was not until 21, that I joined the Vibhavi Academy of Fine Arts, to gain the grounding I needed. Although I was
            very comfortable with pen and ink, I had not worked with pastels until I met Royden Gibbs in 2011, a renowned water
            colour artist. Under his tutelage, I started using soft pastels. Since then, I have honed my pastel rendering skills
            to produce realist-style paintings of animals.
            <br><br>
            I am also a wildlife photographer, as you will no doubt notice (hint: that's a Canon lens, not a cannon!). All the
            reference material for my wildlife paintings are from various excursions around Sri Lanka and England, with a
            handful of shot in other countries. I'm  Committee Member of the London Bird Club (part of the LNHS), and I
            regularly travel with the LBC and RSPB member groups all around the UK to do my part in the conservation of fauna
            and flora. I'm proud to say that a photograph I took of a Stonechat in New Forest adorns the back cover of the
            London Bird Atlas, which was recently published.
            <br><br>
            I currently reside in Balham, London. My home is also my studio, which I have set up in a way to get the most
            natural light.
